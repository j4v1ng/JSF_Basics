			<b>This little program explains basic templating with JSF</b>
			<ul>
			<li>		
			
			First you create a template(A common look and fell for all the pages in your program).
			<br/>
			The parts of the template that may vary(differ), should be warped inside the insert tag, and also is
			<br/>
			very important to give to the insert tag a name.(See MasterLayot.xhtml)
			</li>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<li>
				Then all you need to do is create each different part of the template.
				<br/>
				For that you will create one or many composition pages that define, the elements that should be replaced in the
				<br/>
				template.(This page(index.xhtml), is an example of how to do it, have a look at its source code)
				<br/>
				You just need to use the composition and define(With the name of the insert tag in the template) tags.
