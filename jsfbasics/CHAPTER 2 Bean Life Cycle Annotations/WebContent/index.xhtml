<h3>PAGE LIFECYCLE ANNOTATIONS</h3>

In this example, you will see in the console 2 messages that are displayed
<br/>
when methods annotated with page lifecycle annotations are executed.
<br/>
@PostConstruct: When the bean is created
<br/>
@PreDestroy: Just before it bean goes out of scope
<br/>
(Example: In a Request scoped bean the method will be executed, after the server response,
<br/>but just before the bean is destroyed)

<h:form>
<!-- Call a property or something from the bean, so the bean gets created
the bean is request scoped, so the predestroy will be called just before
going out of scope -->
 <h2>#{bd.value}</h2> 
</h:form>
</h:body>
</html>
