	<b>EXPLANATION:</b>
	<br/>
	It you submit a value, it will be submited and displayed at the destination page.
	<br/>
	Since the backing bean is @SessionScoped, the value will remain saved,untill the
	<br/>
	session ends or expires(Session is ended when invalidate() method is called)
	<br/>
	<b>Notes:
	<br/>
	 - that a new browser window is opened, that counts as a new session(Another user)
	 <br/>
	 -Warning: Some browsers(like chrome) will use the same session even if a new browser window
	 <br/>
	 is opened by the same user, but if you open the program again in a different browser, you will see that the session
	 <br/>
	 is different.(It makes sense for browsers, to behave like this because, they think that if a new browser window is openned,
	 <br/>
	 it is the same user that opened it)
	 <br/>
	 -If we navagate away and then come back, the value remain, becouse it is Session scoped
